MapReduce's use at Google:
  - MapReduce is *batch* oriented.
  - MapReduce would receive the epic amounts of webpage data collected by Google's crawlers 
  - MapReduce would crunch this down to the links and metadata needed to actually search these pages. 
  - Among so many other things, it would determine each site's PageRank
    * PageRank: the site's relationship to all the other sites on the web.
    
Why not MapReduce at Google:
  - Goal is to update the search index continuously, within seconds of content changing
  - * without* rebuilding the entire index from scratch using MapReduce.
  
PageRank 
  - attempts to measure the relative importance of a website based on what other sites it's linked to.
  
BigTable 
  - a compressed, high performance, and proprietary data storage system built on 
    * Google File System
    * Chubby Lock Service
    * SSTable (log-structured storage like LevelDB) 
    
BigTable 
  - maps two arbitrary string values (row key and column key) and timestamp (hence three dimensional mapping) 
    into an associated arbitrary byte array. 
  - It is not a relational database and can be better defined as a sparse, distributed multi-dimensional sorted map.

Google's Spanner RDBMS 
  - is layered on an implementation of BigTable with a Paxos group for two-phase commits to each tablet. 
  - Google F1 was built using Spanner to replace an implementation based on MySQL
