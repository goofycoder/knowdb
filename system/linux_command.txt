$time [./a.out]

Example output:

real    0m0.139s      // Elapsed real time
user    0m0.060s      // Total number of CPU-seconds that the process spent in user mode
sys     0m0.028s      // Total number of CPU-seconds that the process spent in kernel mode

/dev/null or the null device 
  - a special file that discards all data written to it but reports that the write operation succeeded. 
    * not a directory, so cannot move a whole directory into it with 'mv'. 
  - it provides no data to any process that reads from it, yielding EOF immediately
  - typically used for disposing of unwanted output streams of a process, or as a convenient empty file for input streams. 
  - it is usually done by redirection
  - Geek Jargon:
    "Please send complaints to /dev/null" <==> "don't bother sending complaints"
    "redirect to /dev/null"               <==> "go away"
