threaded binary tree
	- "A binary tree is threaded
		* all right child pointers that would normally be null point to the inorder successor of the node
		* all left child pointers that would normally be null point to the inorder predecessor of the node."
	- Pro: 
		1. makes the tree traversal a linear traversal
			* more rapid than a recursive in-order traversal. 
		2. Easier to discover the parent of a node from a threaded binary tree
			* without explicit use of parent pointers or a stack, albeit slowly
			* This can be useful where stack space is limited, or where a stack of parent pointers is unavailable 
			(for finding the parent pointer via DFS).

Graph traversal:
    - Two main ways to traverse the graph:
        * Breadth-first
            - require a queue
            - how it works:
                * as we pop a node off the queue, we copy each of its neighbors, and push them to the queue.
        * Depth-first

Graph basics:
    - directed / undirected

n&(n-1)
    - it will be 0 if it's 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 (2^0, 2^1, 2^2 ....)
 
 AVL tree (Adelson-Velskii and Landis' tree, named after the inventors) 
	- self-balancing binary search tree
	- In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one 
	- if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property. 
	- Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation.	
	- insertions and deletions may require the tree to be rebalancled by one or more tree rotations.
	- For each node checked, if the balance factor remains -1, 0, or +1 then no rotations are necessary. 
	  However, if balance factor becomes less than -1 or greater than +1, the subtree rooted at this node is unbalanced.

AVL tree vs. red-black tree
	- similarity:
		* both support the same set of operations and take O(log n) time for the basic operations. 
		* both are height-balanced, not weight balanced
	- Diff:
		* For lookup-intensive applications, AVL trees are faster than red-black trees because they are more rigidly balanced

Binary Tree vs Binary Search Tree
    - Binary tree:
        * a tree data structure in which each node has at most two child nodes, 
    - Binary Search Tree:
        * binary search tree (BST) (sometimes also called an ordered or sorted binary tree)
            - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
            - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
            - The left and right subtree must each also be a binary search tree.
            - There must be no duplicate nodes.

How to balance the tree:
	- tree rotation is an operation on a binary tree that changes the structure without interfering with the order of the elements. 
	- balanceFactor = height(left-subtree) - height(right-subtree).
