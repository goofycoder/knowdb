Distributed algorithm 
  - an algorithm designed to run on computer hardware constructed from interconnected processors. 
  
Distributed algorithms topics:
  - leader election
  - spanning tree generation
  - consensus
  - distributed search
  - mutual exclusion
  - resource allocation

Leader Election (Symmetry breaking)
  - the process of designating a single process as the organizer of some task distributed among several computers (nodes).
  - The network nodes communicate among themselves in order to decide which of them will get into the "leader" state. 
    For that, they need some method in order to break the symmetry among them. 
       * For example, if each node has unique and comparable identities, then the nodes can compare their identities, 
         and decide that the node with the highest identity is the leader.

Spanning-tree generation
  - Breadth-first search algorithm
    * Mark nodes as they get incorporated into the tree.
        - Initially, only i_0 is marked.
    * Round 1: i_0 sends search message to out-neighbors.
    * At every round: 
        - An unmarked node that receives a search message:
        - Marks itself.
        - Designates one process from which it received search as its parent.
        - Sends search to out-neighbors at the next round.
    * Yields a BFS tree because all the branches are created synchronously.
  - Complexity: Time = diam + 1; Messages = |E|
