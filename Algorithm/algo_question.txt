Q: Have a huge file that cannot fit into memory. Each line has a string. How to sort the file?

A: Extenal sort. (Disk-based sorting)
   Assume the file is N. The available memory is M.
  
   Idea: 
    1. Divide the file into K chunks, where M * K = N. 
       Bring each chunk into memory and sort the lines as usual using any O(n log n) algorithm. 
       Save the lines back to the file.
    2. Now bring the next chunk into memory and sort.
    3. (K-way merge) Once weâ€™re done, merge them one by one.
