=============================================

ASyntax Notation One (ASN.1) 
    - a standard and notation that describes rules and structures for representing, encoding and decoding data in computer networking
    - standard ASN.1 encoding rules include:
        * Basic Encoding Rules (BER)
        * Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)
        * etc

Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)
    - DER uses a pattern of type-length-value (TLV) triplets
        30 — type tag indicating SEQUENCE
        02 — type tag indicating INTEGER
        16 — type tag indicating IA5String 

X.509
    - an ITU-T standard for a public key infrastructure (PKI) 
    - specifies
        * standard formats for public key certificates
        * certificate revocation lists
        * attribute certificates
        * a certification path validation algorithm
        * etc
    - Strict hierarchical system of certificate authorities (CAs) for issuing the certificates.

Structure of Digital Certificate
    - The structure is expressed in a formal language (ASN.1) 
    - The structure of an X.509 v3 digital certificate is as follows:
        * Certificate
            - Version
                * v1,v2,v3
            - Serial Number
                * MUST be unique for each certificate issued by a specific CA
            - Algorithm ID
            - Issuer
                * identifies the entity that has signed and issued the certificate.  
                * MUST contain a non-empty distinguished name (DN).
            - Validity
                * Not Before
                * Not After
            - Subject
                * identifies the entity associated with the public key stored in the subject public key field.
                * most important part is usually  common name (CN),
                    - as this is the part that must match the host being authenticated. 
            - Subject Public Key Info
                * Public Key Algorithm
                * Subject Public Key
            - Issuer Unique Identifier (optional)
            - Subject Unique Identifier (optional)
            - Extensions (optional)
                * provide methods for:
                    - associating additional attributes with users or public keys
                    - managing relationships between CAs
            - Certificate Signature Algorithm
            - Certificate Signature
                * created using CA's private key <==> CA signed this cert

Self-signed certificate (root certificates, top-level cert)
    - the issuer and subject are the same
    - the highest-ranking CA's certificate can't be attested by some other higher CA (there being none), and so that certificate can only be "self-signed." 
    - Such certificates are also termed root certificates.
    - Self-signed certificates cannot (by nature) be revoked
    - *usually stored by browsers 
    - globally trusted certificate that can sign anything (as there are no constraints in 'Basic Constraints' section),

Certification Authority (CA) 
    - issues a certificate binding a public key to a particular distinguished nam
    - indicate the revocation status of the certificates that they issue
        * by CRL, OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol), etc. 
        * CA is usually CRL issuer, but it can delegate this to different entity
    - CAs are third parties and require both parties to trust the CA

RA (registration authority)
    - an optional system to which CA delegates certain management functions

Architectual weakness of PKI
    - Revocation of root certificates not addressed
    - Use of blacklisting invalid certificates (using CRLs and OCSP) instead of whitelisting
    - CRLs are particularly poor because of size and distribution patterns
    
Certificate revocation list (CRL).  
    - a time-stamped list identifying revoked certificates that is signed by a CA or CRL issuer
    - made freely available in a public repository.
    - Each revoked certificate is identified in a CRL by its certificate serial number.

How to validate the certificate?
    - check the certificate signature and validity 
    - acquire a suitably recent CRL and checks that the certificate serial number is not on that CRL.
