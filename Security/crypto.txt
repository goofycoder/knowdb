Two-factor authentication (2FA)
  - a way of logging into websites that requires more than just a password. Using a password to log into a website is susceptible to security threats, because it represents a single piece of information a malicious person needs to acquire. 
  - The added security that 2FA provides is requiring additional information to log in.
  - Example: GitHub login
      * additional information is a code delivered to your cell phone
          - either as a text message or generated by an application on smartphone. 
          - GitHub generates a security code that is sent to phone any time someone attempts to log into GitHub account.
