IPSec
  - a protocol suite for securing IP communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet of communication session. 
  - can be used in protecting data flows between 
      * a pair of hosts (host-to-host)
      * a pair of security gateways (network-to-network)
      * a security gateway and a host (network-to-host)
  - IKE daemon: runs in user space 
    IPsec stack: in the kernel that processes the actual IP packets.

IPsec protocol suite 
  - IPsec uses the following protocols to perform various functions:
    * Authentication Headers (AH): [protocol number 51] 
      - provide connectionless integrity and data origin authentication for IP datagrams 
      - provide protection against replay attacks
        * sliding window
    * Encapsulating Security Payloads (ESP):  [protocol number 50]
      - provide:
        * confidentiality
        * data-origin authentication
        * connectionless integrity
        * anti-replay service (a form of partial sequence integrity)
        * limited traffic-flow confidentiality
    * Security Associations (SA) 
      - provide the bundle of algorithms and data that provide the parameters necessary to AH and/or ESP operations. 
      - Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) provides 
          * a framework for authentication and key exchange,
          * with actual authenticated keying material provided by 
            - manual configuration with pre-shared keys
            - Internet Key Exchange (IKE and IKEv2)
            - Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys (KINK)

Internet Key Exchange (IKE or IKEv2) 
  - the protocol used to set up a security association (SA) in the IPsec protocol suite
  - use UDP packets [usually on port 500]
  - generally requires 4-6 packets with 2-3 turn-around times to create an SA on both sides. 
  - Negotiated key material is then given to the IPsec stack.

security association (SA)
  - Simply the bundle of algorithms and parameters (such as keys)
  - used to encrypt and authenticate a particular flow in one direction. 
  - in normal bi-directional traffic, the flows are secured by a pair of SAs

IPSec mode
  - host-to-host transport mode
      * Only the payload of the IP packet is usually encrypted and/or authenticated. 
      * Routing is intact, since the IP header is neither modified nor encrypted; 
  - network tunnel mode
      * entire IP packet is encrypted and/or authenticated. 
      * then encapsulated into a new IP packet with a new IP header. 
 
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) 
  - a communications protocol for secure communication over a computer network
  - not a protocol in and of itself; simply layering HTTP on top of the SSL/TLS protocol
      * add the security capabilities of SSL/TLS to standard HTTP communications.



Two-factor authentication (2FA)
  - a way of logging into websites that requires more than just a password. Using a password to log into a website is susceptible to security threats, because it represents a single piece of information a malicious person needs to acquire. 
  - The added security that 2FA provides is requiring additional information to log in.
  - Example: GitHub login
      * additional information is a code delivered to your cell phone
          - either as a text message or generated by an application on smartphone. 
          - GitHub generates a security code that is sent to phone any time someone attempts to log into GitHub account.
